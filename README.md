Layer Cake Example
===

This is a starter example for using [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics). It sets you up with the line and area chart as seen [in the examples](https://layercake.graphics/Line). It also comes with all the other components from the [guide](https://layercake.graphics) so you can mix and match.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit mhkeller/layercake-template my-chart
cd my-chart
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

## Developing

```
