# datanewsdesk-project-starter

This is the data news desk project starter template.

## Publish on main

Projects using this template will automatically publish anything in the `public` directory to `https://projects.datanews.studio/[repo-name]` when code is pushed to the the `main` branch.

Note that this only works for **public** repositories.
